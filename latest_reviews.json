        "Review": "This mouse is replacing an older wired mouse that I really liked, but after two of those old ones failed within a year, I figured I'd pull the trigger on this one.  I was not disappointed.  It feels good in the hand, has a great DPI adjustment, and ALL the buttons are programmable (including the stock DPI settings button by the scroll wheel).  The included weight disk to put in the bottom is a nice feature, too.  I like a heavier mouse.I leave the \"bling\" (the RGB lights) turned off to extend battery life between charges, and it lasts me days without getting low doing it that way.  If you MUST have the RGB switched on, it will drain the battery faster, but it comes with a handy charger/dongle adapter which you could even use as a wired mouse if you really wanted to.  All in all, one of the better mice Logitech has made in recent years.",

        "Review": "I originally purchased a G305 Mouse.  It replaces the Microsoft 4000 mouse that I had been purchasing for years.  The G305 had a bad dongle, so I purchased the G703 as a replacement.The G703 is a great mouse.  I like where the charging port it and the guides it uses to secure the cable to the mouse.  So far I have been charging it once a week and have never run out of battery power.  If you download the G Hub app, it will let you know the battery level and charging progress.  It's pretty much required if you like a higher sensitivity for your mouse setting.The one beef....  Logitech... could you have a socket for the dongle to be placed in.  I travel a lot and take it with me.  I am always worried about loosing the dongle.",

I use a double click detector on google site, everyday since I've got this mouse I test 200 clicks on left and right click. I get 0 double clicks error.Also the logitech software on PC has been updated and I have 0 issues with it as mentioned on some of the reviews on here. Also the range and disconnecting issue I have not encountered them ( PRO TIP: USE the cable extension that it came with as this acts as an antenna extender and place the USB dongle away from your PC, metal, or any electronics that can cause interference. Also make sure to separate from other wireless dongles IE: Logitech G915 Wreless).As for its size and ergonomics, it is very comfortable to use.  I have very small hands and it's comfortable for me. It's works great for palm gripper of ypu have small hands.Old review:I was very skeptical about purchasing this but It's been 3 weeks and NO double click issue that people are reporting on other reviews. Very light and premium build. It uses the same Hero sensor as the more expensive G pro  for a lot cheaper price. It's ergonomic and it's perfect for palm grip. Other grip style works well IF YOU HAVE BIG HANDS. For smaller hands palm grip works well. RGB is nice without over doing it. The material they use are premium and there is rubber pad grips on the sides to help slippage. The left/right and side button clicks are one of the best feeling in the market. The wheel scroll is also very good. Unfortunately there is no infinite scroll but it's NOT deal breaker what so ever. ONE of the best gaming mouse I've used and it's very sleek looking. Other gaming mouse looks over done with a transformer look to it, which I hate. Lots of good review on YT",

        "Review": "This is a review for the Logitech G703 wireless mouse. I have had two in a three year time span.I am generally a fan of this mouse.I won't speak to the shape of it too much because that is very subjective per each individual. I will note, though this may be obvious, that the G703 is definitely designed to be a right-handed mouse. I personally find it ergonomic to use - I am right-handed, hand size is 10cm wide by 17cm long, and use this mouse mostly in a claw grip.The long-standing gripe with the G703 is that the scroll wheel tends to flake out, and my first purchase of the G703 was no exception to this. For me, the scroll wheel issues started to occur three years after purchase. The issue is that the scroll wheel would sort of chatter and spaz out on screen - the physical scroll wheel works fine mechanically, but the scroll wheel input is wildly inconsistent. For example, if you scroll down the same exact way three times, you may scroll down normally on the PC the first time, then the second time it actually scrolls up (even though you physically scrolled down) and the third time it will scroll down but at a very different rate than before.I worked with customer service to diagnose the issue and they could not find a mechanical problem. I eventually took the mouse apart and can confirm that there is no mechanically broken component or debris in the mouse to cause this at a mechanical level - there is likely something wrong with the actual electric or software components of the mouse.Other than that one big, glaring issue, I really like this mouse! I use it mostly for office work and internet browsing, though I have also used it for gaming. I am not a pro FPS player and cannot comment on the super fine details like latency and pixel/DPS accuracy, but I use this mostly on wireless and see 0 issues on my end.",

        "Review": "I'm a huge FPS fan, and let me tell you, the Logitech G703 has been a game-changer (pun intended!). This wireless mouse is seriously smooth, with the Hero 25K sensor making my aim feel laser-precise. No more jitters or lag, even during those intense clutch moments. Plus, it's super lightweight, so I can flick it around the mousepad like nobody's business.Speaking of clutch moments, I remember one round in Valorant where everything came down to the wire. We were planting the bomb on B site, and the last enemy was lurking somewhere. My heart was pounding, but thanks to the G703's pinpoint accuracy, I was able to track him down through the smoke and secure the win. My teammates were going crazy!Overall, the G703 is an absolute beast for any gamer who takes their performance seriously. It's comfortable, responsive, and packed with features that make a real difference in the heat of the battle. If you're looking for a wireless mouse that won't let you down, look no further.",

        "Review": "Third G703 over 5+ years. First one's scroll wheel broke after a few months. Got a replacement through Logitech warranty (no issues), and have been using that one since then. Just recently the left click started to not be consistent. Probably just worn out. Only difference I can feel with the new G703 is the scroll wheel is more distinct, which is a huge plus for me. Obviously, it has the upgraded sensor, but everything else feels exactly the same. I just wish they made a larger version. This thing is tiny.I only use 400 and 800 DPI (400 for games, 800 for desktop), and I use on-board memory and turn all the lights off to maximize battery life. This makes the application a one time use then uninstall sort of thing once I've set the mouse up (which I really like. I don't like having to have other applications running, especially for something like my mouse).",

        "Review": "Complete Old Logitech G703Before I purchased this mouse, I was using an old version of Logitech G703, which has PMW3366 sensor inside it.The package arrived without any physical or cosmetic damage, but the same can't be said about mouse. The mouse's feet/skates looked like somebody took the mouse for a test drive before putting it back inside a box. The sides of the scroll wheel looked shabby, as if somebody was scratching them with long nails.The software support of the new and the old versions are like night and day. The new version works only with infamous G Hub software, while the old version can work with either G Hub or Logitech Gaming software. While both software programs are horrible and unnecessary in their own unique ways, The Gaming software lets you at least turn off LEDs. That is right; G Hub does not have an option of turning off LEDs on the wireless mouse, which has a limited battery life. The only way to do that is through on board memory configurator, which is like a small .exe file, which lets you configure your mouse without installing any kind of manufacturers\u2019 software/bloatware. Another good point in Gaming software is that it has a notification for when the battery drops to 30 percent of battery life, which is quite useful for prolonging the battery\u2019s factory lifespan. G Hub has that too, but for some reason, it malfunctions from time to time. The only thing I would have added is an option of stopping the charging process when the battery gets to a certain number of percent.The weight reduction in the new version is almost similar to an old version. Since I lightly modified the whole case of my old G703 to honeycomb style and got it to eight five grams, personally, I do not feel any significant difference between almost hundred eight and almost ninety eight grams. From my point of view, there are many unnecessary parts inside the case of the mouse, which can be easily removed for a smoother and lighter feel. The main weight reduction in the new version is not only from a smaller battery, but also from a smaller/thinner PCB. The old PCB\u2019s weight is around fourteen-fifteen grams, while the new PCB is somewhere between ten-eleven grams.As with an old version, both side buttons and front buttons have a palpable free space between the micro switch and buttons\u2019 plastic hump, which touches the stem of the switch. Because of that, there is a potential increase in latency. After I replaced Chinese Omron micro switches to TTC gold micro switches in the old version, the space between the micro switch and buttons\u2019 plastic hump is almost non-existent. Perhaps the solution to this issue are micro switches with either longer stems or bigger case height than on Chinese Omron switches.The sensor itself works as great as the old PMW3366. I did not notice any lags/jitters while I was using it in four different competitive FPS titles. The only difference is that it is less power hungry than PMW3366.The new version of G703 was released in 2019, but for some reason, Logitech still uses USB micro B port instead of USB type C to this day. It feels like Logitech purchased several trucks full of these USB micro B ports and since the money was already spent, they just need to use them until they are completely gone.The battery life is much better than the old version. I use the mouse without any LEDs, on three thousand two hundred DPI and on thousand Hertz polling rate for four to six hours a day. I try to charge the battery to eighty percent whenever it drops to thirty percent. The seven hundred fifty mAh battery in the old version needs to be recharged every third day, while the two hundred forty mAh battery in the new version stays strong for almost two weeks without any charge.Overall, the shape of the mouse and the mouse itself are great, but it feels like this version is what the old G703 was supposed to be. I hope that Logitech either release the better version of G703 or a better variation of an ergonomic mouse.",

I recommend anyone that owns a wider mouse to do some measurements beforehand as this mouse was quickly cramping my hands during gaming.The only other issue I had was the scroll wheel. It is extremely clicky - a bit difficult to press and fairly loud. This may not be a problem for everyone, so I don\u2019t see a reason to take off a star for this or anything else for that matter.

        "Review": "I went from a G502 to the HyperX Pulsefire Haste. Wow, was that a mistake. I came running back to Logitech after exactly a year of dealing with HyperX and a constant bug that changed my DPI randomly.I palm/claw grip and have smaller hands, and the G502 felt a little bulky for me, so I wanted to try this before shelling out for the Pro. I love it and missed having working software. The shape finally gives my hand a good place to sit. It would be perfect it was a little lighter. I removed the stock skates (very easy to do) and added some X-ray Ruby pads. It definitely made a great difference to subside the weight a bit. I also paired this with the Pulsar Gaming Gears SUPERGRIP for the G703, and it's by far the best grip IMO. It's way easier to clean than the other grips that have deep indentations. And it just looks super clean/minimal. It's overall an excellent mouse, would purchase again.I only have one complaint. With half the battery life of the G502, it's very noticeable how much more often I have to charge it. I WFH and also game on my computer, so I'm using my mouse all day, every day, and I end up charging the mouse every 4-ish nights. That's not too bad, but it's worth noting for those used to the G502 battery.",

Lots of customization via it's program along with macros and such.However, it's uses proprietary wires and goes out of it's way to make sure that any other standard wireless charging methods do not work for this mouse. The charging port in front is too small to fit a USB-C despite it looking like it could fit one so you need the cable it comes with and god forbid you have pets who decide to chew because Logitech doesn't provide or sell replacements (because they'd rather you buy a new mouse). There's the wireless option, which is a joke, because it only comes in the form of a 80$ mouse pad you need to plug in; which I feel misses the plot at this point and might as well buy a wired mouse. And this is probably the only time I give praise to products made by a certain country that starts with a C since they don't give a F about our proprietary patent BS and will happily fill in that market for them. So thank Pooh there are 3rd party options.So in summary: Again, the mouse is fantastic. I just hate it when companies resort to scummy tactics to try to get customers to buy their products again when something small goes wry. But if you MUST have this mouse know that there are 3rd party cables and chargers available so you won't be totally screwed when something goes wrong. Keep in mind this doesn't change the fact that you NEED to buy accessories made ONLY FOR THIS PRODUCT just for something as simple as charging the battery which is the main reason why stuff like this pisses me off.",

So I was able to salvage it, but the 3rd party wheel (while very good) isn't quite perfect. Regardless, I shouldn't have had to spend time/money fixing it. There's no good reason I can see to design the wheel spindle the way it is. It is clearly a weak point.Lots of other reviews talk about what's great about this mouse, and generally I agree with most of that but I'll skip straight to the pertinent part of my review. It felt solid and like the best mouse I've ever owned...until it broke. I really liked this mouse, but it just broke in a really dumb way so I felt compelled to come leave this review. I know mice aren't usually made to last forever, but the specific way this one broke just feels unnecessary and easily preventable. I've had it almost exactly 3 years, and I do *not* abuse it. I play a lot of games on controller now anyway, so it has seen only light or moderate usage in that time. The scroll wheel especially saw only light usage (the part that broke). The tip of the little plastic spindle that is attached to the center of the wheel snapped off while I was *very* slowly scrolling a webpage, so now the mouse can't tell when you're spinning the wheel and scrolling does nothing. I am currently attempting to super glue it back together, but it's not going well haha. I've attached a photo with the part I'm talking about circled (after attempting to glue it back together).",

I mostly use it for work, and it's equally comfortable in my hand and easier on my wrist because it's so much lighter and easier to move. It doesn't have side scrolling, but I mapped the thumb buttons to scroll, and it works great. Also, clicking the scroll wheel enables scroll-based-on-offset mode which is great for scrolling (either vertically or horizontally) without needing to keep scrolling the wheel or pressing the button. Also, it's now much easier to drag things exactly one pixel for graphics work, which I didn't realize was previously frustrating until it started being easy with this mouse. Overall very useable for work.For gaming, this mouse is a huge step up. I mostly play StarCraft 2, and since getting the new mouse my accuracy is way better - I didn't realize how slow I had to move before to make sure I was clicking the right thing! It really feels like my hand suddenly got more coordinated. I don't do FPS much anymore, but I imagine it would make a big difference there too. Not a ton of buttons, so maybe not great for RPGs where you want to map a ton of things. But the core point-and-click experience is really great.",

Then I looked online and saw several answers that made it sound like you had to purchase the weight separately and it was not included.  A couple of the answers were marked as from Logitech so I presumed it was correct and wrote a scathing review.But I happened to think, \"no.  I've purchased many a Logitech product and this did not seem right.\"  I checked the packaging again and tucked into the place where the wireless dongle had been was the weight.  It must have been hidden under it and was well wedged into place.So if you're like me and you want that extra weight in your mouse, re-examine your packaging.  This weight does indeed come with the mouse and tucks nicely under the compartment under the mouse that's secured by a cover using a couple of magnets.Only time will tell if this product holds up but so far I've enjoyed it.  I do wish it had the button/feature for free mouse wheel scroll but it's holding up under limited use nicely.",

That's the biggest slice of the market, after all. But, for a lot of people, they are way to small. Your fingers will hand off the G Pro Wireless or the Razer Viper or any of the other light and superlight models on the market.The g703 is already quite light, and more importantly you need a mouse that will fit into your hand correctly. Hitting a few shots but giving yourself permanent damage from holding a tiny mouse for hours at a time is not a good tradeoff.Also, I would recommend looking into a dock for these - you can charge whenever you aren't using the mouse so that you never have to plug in the cord.",

All three of them had issues with the scroll wheel.  The first two I think were earlier versions but the scrollwheel would not register correctly and would go up instead of down severely while browsing or in game.  For the recent versions of the G703 the scrollwheel broke down and malfunctioned.  The third one within 2 years and the fourth one within 6 months (i'm in the middle of a warranty exchange since it's still eligible I really hope they honor it).  I've used this mouse for everyday use and maybe 3-4 hours of gaming every night but I really think the scroll wheel (running down/breakingdown) shouldn't be an issue.If it didn't have consistent scroll wheel issues I'd give this 5 stars because otherwise this is a very good mouse for gaming/wireless/everyday use.  I love everything else about it until you're met iwth a malfunctioned scroll wheel wearing out or just not going up and down accurately.",

I have been using this for about 2-3 months as of now. It's created a clear improvement in my gaming and everyday experience.In terms of gaming I mainly play fps. For the most part I am pretty good at them, expect for Valorant. Well, not any more. Sure I have spent some time training in the practice range, but I have to say I saw a significant difference in my performance when I switched mouses.Another game which has been impacted is TeamFight Tactics and League of legends. Although they are the polar opposite of a shooter the mouse has given me the right amount of precision. It was slight, but I used to have an issue where sometimes it felt like I was clicking a little bit away from where I wanted to click. This mouse has solved any precision issues I've had.The only flaw that I've really had with this mouse is the placement of the dpi- button. Maybe my hands are too big or I just move my hand around a lot, but sometimes I click it on accident without noticing. its not a huge issue and I notice it pretty quickly, but it had happened 4 or five times already.In terms of battery not many comments to add. It lasts a really really long time. I have it on and use it pretty much every day for about 6-7 hours and it keeps going for a long time. It usually lasts like two weeks before needing charge.",

This is a very good product at the end of the day, but you should understand it comes with a few cons. Let's get into it and tell you why this 3 star product is the best \"gaming\" mouse on the market (right handed only review).+ Design is simple and comfortable with your hands (layout). No awkward accidental hits die to weirdly placed buttons.+ Looks fantastic, and the RBG plays into the fun factor.+ Materials feel nice against your skin. Grippy, yet soft.+ Weight is excellent. I like using the heaviest 'coin' insert.+ Response time is as fast as the quickest wired mice. Enough said.+ Sensor accuracy is bar none the best. I've tried it all. This doesn't skip. I can't make it skip or stutter. This is rare, as I can make anything else skip pretty easily with flick type shots or 180 spins. Final Mouse, Rival, Sensei, all lack here.. Make sure you get the PMW3366 sensor, not the older SKU.+ Software is easy enough to use and configure to your specific wants. Full macro control.+ No cord snag, which is very nice for fast competitive gaming, especially FPS.+ Charge life is excellent, with or without RBG cycling.Now I know you're confused why 3 stars after all these glowing points. Read the second negative, and it's why this product isn't a 5/5 stars. To me, it's a big flaw.- Weighted coin insert not included in the newest sensor revision. I use mine from the old mouse, which broke. For a mouse so expensive... Really Logitech?- Mouse wheel is atrocious. It comes a little stiff that you can press down, and it won't scroll also. But the wheel gets \"broken in\" very quickly and then becomes an utter mess. Depending on what you use Mouse3 for, it can really impact you negatively. I've gone through many of these mice, and they are all the same. I press Mouse3 in (middle button) and it's a damn challenge to not scroll with it to. Want to use the scroll function? Try to go 1 tick, but it goes multiple because it's so loose and flimsy. This one button is the death of me. The best mouse on the market with a disastrous flaw. This mouse wheel is one of the worst I've had ever tested, which is strange. The best mouse wheel I've tested is still the old school Logitech G400s. I guess now days they try to save costs in something they think is over looked. Sad cause the rest of the mouse seems premium.",

Battery life is decent even with the RGB on, I get 3-5 days/charge with heavily varying hours of use. I knocked off a star because the best implementation is to have a switch on the bottom for the RGB lighting in my opinion. But, that's my only issue with it. The best way to use a high DPI mouse is to crank up the DPI on the mouse and lower it far down in the games and stuff you're using. That way, you have a lot of precision. The Teflon feet slide around almost effortlessly on my mousepad, and it's also very quiet to move around. It can handle being mad and slammed on a bit, just mind the scrollwheel because that is a failure point if dropped.Overall, it's nicely weighted, and clicky.",

However, 6 months after using this mouse, the scroll wheel malfunctioned. At first, it wasn't that big of a deal, but it progressively became more irritating and frustrating because the scroll wheel wanted to work on its own time. Trying to scroll down would result in the page scrolling up SOMETIMES, or it just wouldn't work. Then there are also moments when the scroll wheel moves down on its own without me touching or using it. It became so annoying that I decided enough is enough and purchased a new mouse. If the scroll wheel hadn't malfunctioned, this would have been the best gaming mouse I have ever purchased. Unfortunately, I don't know if I'll ever purchase another Logitech mouse because of the issue with this scroll wheel.Pros:1. Exceptional for gaming2. Has weights on the mouse that you can adjust to your own liking3. Feels comfortable to hold/Isn't too big for people with smaller/medium-sized hands.4. The wireless battery life lasts for A WHILE (the longest it's lasted for me was 2 1/2 weeks)Cons:1. Scroll wheel decided to give out on me 6 months in.2. Adding on to the scroll wheel bit: Even when trying not to use the scroll wheel, it would work on its own and randomly scroll up or down without me touching it.

After just a year and a half of regular use, the scroll wheel has died. This is the third time now I feel Logitech has screwed me... It used to be they had quality products that lasted. When I updated my OS to Win10, they said \"We don't care if your saitek flight controls worked fine yesterday, now that we own them, we do not wish to continue supporting them, go buy a new set of our flight controls. Here are some (high end) recommendations at $300+\". Then I eventually had to replace my keyboard and got my G710. I have loved it since I got it (the only problems I have with the keyboard are that the letters on the keycaps are wearing out, and when they updated their software a while back, it seems to no longer recognize the keyboard, thus I can not reprogram the G-Keys (which are the only thing that really sets it apart from anyone elses keyboard) so I now have G-Keys that are permanently bound to macros for games I no longer play), BUT that lead me to pick up a mouse here from amazon and a headset from a local big box store. The headset hinge broke within a couple weeks, and the mouse only lasted a year and a half. I now can only believe that Logitech quality control has declined since I got my keyboard.The headset I returned to the box store for a refund.I use this mouse every day for work and gaming. It is comfortable to use, and has decent battery life (though other brands have up to twice the life). I did have trouble with the wireless not liking to be plugged directly into my laptop that I never figured out, but the dongle works on the charging cable so I was not overly concerned once I got it working. The RGB control software seems to occasionally forget my settings, but that is minor. And last but not least, not all my games like playing nice with the DPI switching, but at least they do not default to the low setting. Prior to the sudden failure of the scroll wheel I had been looking at getting the powerplay wireless charging mousepad to go with my mouse. I DID genuinely like my mouse, but it died much too soon, now I distrust the brand as the quality control seems to be declining.I can not recommend buy Logitech products for the foreseeable future. Perhaps at some point in the not too distant future I will take the mouse apart and see what actually broke. If it is just a plastic piece, I may be able to repair it, or even make a new housing for the electronics, but for now I am stuck looking to purchase a decent wireless mouse from a different brand.",

I noticed easily a week worth of PC time (30+ hours just on weekdays alone)The DPI adjustment is absolutely absurd, in a good way.

However, with this mouse you only have 2 settings, either setting it to a setting where it would raise the volume by extremely fast increments from one click or setting it to only go up 1 increment per click. This isn't a major issue so I wouldn't expect anyone other than me and like 2 other people in the world to have a problem but I just wished it had the finer control like it did with the G303.

I literally cannot bear to use this mouse with these feet. Very slow glide, a lot of resistance/friction, and inconsistent feel. I recommend replacing them right away with Corepads (which I bought, they're in shipping) or Superglides. Other than the feet, my big complaint with this mouse is, surprisingly, not the weight. It's the shape. This mouse is sneakily large and has an aggressive, prominent hump that is tough to distinguish in pictures. This mouse is definitely meant to cater towards the large-handed audience that I am not a part of.To exaggerate the uncomfortableness of the awkward hump and large size, this mouse weighs in at around the 100g mark, which is fairly heavy and makes the bad feet more noticeable. Even a G305 with a basic AA battery weighs a few grams less, which makes the G703 look bad when considering that it is a rechargeable mouse. Speaking of rechargeable, this mouse uses the archaic micro-USB port, but thankfully the port has enough space that your own cable can fit and you aren't forced to use the included one.The good parts of this mouse include the primary and side buttons, rubberized side grips, battery life, and easy performance adjustments using the Logitech Onboard Memory Manager. If you seek a large wireless gaming mouse with good performance and reliable connectivity, I encourage you to consider the Razer DeathAdder V2 Pro or Glorious Model D Wireless instead of the G703, as they are both far better mice in my opinion.",

So, if you're ready for a stellar gaming experience, just be prepared for the occasional time warp back to the era of micro USB inconveniences and a good laugh at this mouse's tech-relic quirkiness.",

I haven't used it on any games because i still use my wireless mouse for full range of motion and waited to open it. I feel ripped off. I opened the package about 30 minutes ago and all i received within the box was theiuse itself and a cord. I spent a few minutes examining the box to see if there were any hidden compartments to stash the adapter and dongle to avail. Unfortunately, I do not think I will ever use this mouse to game with. All i can say is to open your package as soon as you get it and check it's contents because I did not and now I'm down $80!!! I'd assume it's a good mouse because I've heard very good things about it and i know many people who use this mouse strictly for gaming.",

Will update if any problems arise.Original: First off, I want to mention that I have an average sized hand and use a palm grip on my mouse. I've had this for a little over a month now and I have to say that I love it. The battery life is great on this thing and I typically recharge it every 3 or 4 days (I usually turn it off if I'm not actively using my PC btw). I love the ergonomics on this thing and even more-so than the G502 that's so popular amongst Logitech fans; I even went to Bestbuy to test how the g502 felt in my hand, but I just didn't like the shape of it and it felt like my pinky and ring finger were dragging on the surface a bit too much for my liking, but with the g703 I don't have this issue. I've even gamed for 9 hours straight playing Resident Evil 2 and didn't feel any discomfort at any point using this mouse so needless to say, I'm quite pleased with the ergonomics. The rgb is customizable and simple to do with G Hub and so far I've had a good experience with the software so I can't complain on that front. I honestly don't really have a bad thing to say about this mouse, maybe it's cause I'm a newby and this is the first expensive mouse I've ever owned, but for a first mouse I think it's pretty great pick.",

This mouse, even from the next room (where my projector is set up), is on point every move, every click without any drop in connection so far.The RGB on the mouse is a joy to look at and it syncs up well with my Logitech G506 Lightsync speaker via Logitech G Hub software.I also love the fact that I have the option of switching between wired (via microUSB - data + charging) / wireless connection. I thought about getting a wireless charging mouse pad from Logitech so that I wouldn't have to worry about charging ever. I do really like the idea of that added convenience and the look of the product. However, I don't know if that justifies the ~$100+tax price tag (especially since Logitech wireless charging pad doesn't even have a USB port).Anyways, I'll give it some more time to see if it starts to fail on me but so far, I have not had any issue with it and I must say I do like the mouse itself. I needed a reliable high-performance low-latency wireless mouse for my new set up and Logitech 703 works perfectly fine for me!",

However, I also use MX Master when not gaming for its hyper-scroll wheel and overall more comfortable shape. Gaming wise there is no contest, as the G703 is simply more accurate, faster, and even mouse scrolling is noticeably smoother (tested and verified w/240Hz monitor). It has has weight that you can add optionally if one feels mouse is too light. There are RGB lights on wheel and logo (@palm area) which can be light sync and turn off if desired to save battery.

For me, this means a medium weight mouse with no cord and not having to worry about charging.  Historically, I have used a Wacom tablet with a Wacom accessory mouse atop the Wacom tablet to achieve this \"wireless but never have to charge it\" effect.  Unfortunately, Wacom has stopped producing the mouse accessories.I have the G703 and the PowerPlay charging pad and it's incredible.  I run MacOS and use the Logitech G Hub software.  I've had no problems with this software and it's actually just as good at switching profiles for different development tools as it is at switching for different games.In my use, the mouse is always on the PowerPlay pad so I just never have to worry about charging.  The mouse is always ready to go and there are no compromises like a cord getting in the way.Some people have panned the G Hub software but I've actually found it to be fine.

The coefficient of friction of the underside is a little low and any sloped surface of like 10-15 degrees or higher that doesn\u2019t have its own high coefficient of friction will cause the mouse to slide down. This constantly happens to me on my laptop pad which are often designed with a slight slope to them. If I stop gaming to reply to a text I can bet the mouse is going to slide off and end up somewhere between my lap and oblivion. This is annoying because seemingly without fail the DPI setting button gets hit and the sensitivity gets changed. (I do love the DPI button for on the fly sensitivity changing and it\u2019s not in a spot that should get hit should the mouse tumble, I\u2019m just a special kind of unlucky).If you\u2019re playing on a flat surface, the low coefficient of friction is probably a huge advantage.

When it \"wakes\", it operates at very slow cursor speeds, and takes a good 2-3 seconds for it to go back to the DPI/speed setting you've set it at. Why such a dramatic drop in stars for one simple thing? Because for me it messes up my work flow enough where it makes me consider another mouse, which is such a shame because it's all software related. I've even set the software to not automatically update, yet it still does so.I've owned a lot of mice over the years, all price brackets.This is by far my favorite. Aesthetically I love the fact that it isn't trying to stand out. It looks like how a mouse \"should\" look, plain and functional. However, it fits my hand like a glove. Of course this is subjective, as it may not fit your hand as well.I also love the weight of the mouse. It's not so airy and light that it makes you feel like you're holding a toy, but also not so heavy that it'll fatigue your wrist after a whole day of work (or gaming).Logitech software allows you to customize it to your liking (programmable keys and RGB).Battery lasts a long long time too. I'd plug it in overnight maybe once every 2 weeks not because it needs it, but I like to stay topped off. Plus is, if it does run out of battery, you can still use it while plugged in and charging.I use my equipment alot, and put it through all kinds of usage. It's never let me down once. Highly recommend this mouse.",

But it's not just the best wireless mouse, it's also the best mouse I've ever owned PERIOD. The ergonomics are near perfect, the RGB is great (although the light coming from the mouse wheel is rather dim), and the mouse is very light, which makes it great for gaming and general use combined. Works great both in wired and wireless mode, and there's no perceptible lag when used wireless. Battery life is superb, especially for such a light mouse, and can be extended further if you are willing to turn off the RGB. Software allows for easy configuration of the buttons and DPI sensitivity presets (by default the button below the scroll wheel cycles between four presets), and the RGB lighting, and includes Macro support. Software works well on both PC and Mac (I use the mouse with both). Really don't have any significant complaints except price (it's not a cheap mouse). Can't speak to the long-term durability of the mouse yet since I've only had it about a month, but I've been VERY happy with it so far.Tip: If you don't need wireless check out the cheaper G403 since it's basically identical but lacks the wireless capability. I use that model at work and it's also fantastic.",

I do add the extra optional 10g weight, because I like my mice a little bit heavier.I've previously used a G403 wireless, and a G703 (non hero).  The original G703 was *nearly* perfect, but the battery life really wasn't great.  At most I would get ~20 hours of use before it needed to be charged.  With the new Hero version I'm able to consistently get 30-35 hours, that's a pretty great improvement.Software note:I was previously using the older Logitech Gaming Software to control my G513 and G703 non-hero, but apparently the new G703 Hero isn't supported or detected by the older software, so I was forced to switch over to the newer Logitech GHub software.  Had some issues with lighting effects not working correctly at first when I switched the software.  I wound up having to completely uninstall both the old LGS and the Ghub software, restart, then do a clean install of the GHUB software and now everything is working great.About the only thing I could think to possibly improve this mouse would be some option physically see on the mouse itself what the remaining battery life is, maybe an LED indicator?",

        "Review": "I had an MX518 for so long that I don't even remember when/where I got it, it still worked, but I decided to replace it because it was generating an annoying high-pitched noise.I didn't want to initially go with a wireless mouse or a mouse this expensive, but it certainly is a nice replacement for the MX518; in comparison, the ergonomics feel good, the button layout is similarly positioned, and the weight is comparable. One of the best selling points for me is the ability to keep it wired, keeping it tethered doesn't add any additional drag that you're not already accustomed to with a wired mouse and it prevents my toddler from thinking he can walk off with it.I removed the old Logitech Gaming software and installed the \"G\" software for the G703 and was able to quickly setup the DPI setting similarly to the MX518 to get the same feel.Can't go wrong with the G703 as a replacement for the MX518.",

        "Review": "For the current price, this mouse is a steal if you don't mind the weight. This thing weighs in at around 92 grams if you use it without the plastic pluck at the bottom of the mouse. The stock feet are not up to par, I replaced them with corepads. Other than that it's a good wireless mouse with nice clicks. My only gripe is that after a week there are marks on the side grip that indicates signs of wear, so I feel like this mouse isn't going to last as long since it looks like the area where I place my thumb is wearing down,",

        "Review": "A lot of improvements aren\u2019t super obvious until you have to go back and use the old version and then all of the quality of life improvements you\u2019ve gotten used to seem like necessities now and you wonder how you ever lived without them before.This was not that for me.I had previously been using a dell mouse that was included with a laptop a friend of mine bought circa 2009 and I only upgraded because my old mouse broke. The moment I touched this mouse I new gaming would never be the same. For anyone that is still using the cheap peripherals that came with your computer or the Walmart special you picked up for $9.99, just buy a new proper gaming mouse. It\u2019s worth the money more than just about anything else in your set up and Logitech provides a great product here. I love this product so much I even started taking it work.",

        "Review": "I am a 120 kg man. I am not a small guy, so is my hand. I think this mouse is not for everyone, especially for tiny people. I had a Roccat Lua before this one. It was OK, but it was smaller, so there was a gap between the hand and the mouse. Now there is no gap. The hand holds firmly the mouse. The wheel is very quiet. I used the provided weight to increase mouse's weight. I really like bigger and heavy tools. The battery seems to be enough for about a week, depending how much you work. I am a designer, so i use it a lot.Everything seems OK for the moment. Will update alter if I find anything new.",

        "Review": "I also have a normal, non gaming mouse and you replace the batteries once a year. When it's time to go to bed, you shut down and go to sleep. With this, you need to put the cord in before leaving or you will be using it with the wire soon. A charge will last a few days, but, I don't want to keep changing it, I bought a wireless for a reason, so I don't need a wire... Also, the dongle will not work for my keyboard so I still need 2 USB ports, my computer only has 4, so I needed to buy a hub to use both, and I am constantly switching the dongle out to charge the mouse. The Ghub software required to make use of the features is not compatible with my OS so I had to install a hacked version. The Pinky side of the mouse is slopped so you don't get a good grip on that side. As for the DPI, the whole reason I got this, it is great! I finally get the speed I want without skipping pixels, but, with all the other hassle, I can't score this mouse as high as I wanted to.",

        "Review": "The product worked fine with no issues for about 9 months. The mouse felt nice and is very customizable with the driver it comes with. However, after 9 months the left click started acting up, and now I've needed to use another mouse because of its effect on my gaming. When I hold down the left click button, the input doesn't seem to maintain itself pressed, because when I shoot a gun in games such as Overwatch or Valorant, the gun sometimes shoots in bursts even if it's fully automatic. I promise I am holding down the left click just fine, and I didn't have this problem for the first 9 months. Unfortunately, I can no longer refund this mouse, so I figured I'd at least write a warning. It may not affect all of them, but it sure did happen to me without any sort of damage to the mouse itself.",

        "Review": "Usually I don't update my product reviews but in this ocassion I would like to do it since I really appreciate the comfort and ergonomy of this mouse. The sensitivity is adjustable, the hand feeling is so soft and without a heavy sensation, just the correct quantity of useful buttons and the material is not at all a bad quality rubber that may be with the time could be have a sticky feeling, this mouse has a great quality rubber in the laterals, the wireless connection is stablished, in rare ocassions I could see a lag to recognize the mouse but in few seconds is recovered again, even though if you don't want any possible lag (again this has happen to me just 3 times in the last 8 months) you can use the usb cable and you'll have a wired connection without problems. The charging is very quick and the battery life, now that I use it everyday working from home, after 2 weeks need to charge while is charging I can use it with the usb cable. Really I love this product, highly recommended.",
